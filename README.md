# CHANGE LOG

## Patch 1.1.01
  * Initial build.
  * Building native support to APIS Case Management system. Native MyWegmansConnect integration will occur in future patches through Single Sign On/Apereo.
  * Full integration with Incident Management-level remote access to Genetec access feeds through both desktop and Smart devices.
  * Currently testing feasibility of restricted access using AirWatch Agent as means for delivering app.
  
  ### On THE BACKBURNER...
  * Field Notes app.
  * Integration with Wegmans Outlook for Personal Devices (Considering intregration with AirWatch to provide this?)
  * PICS System Access
  * JRE Runtime error for Genetec feeds - Android app, times out when client changes camera angle and/or zooms in. Team 2 needs to double down on this ASAP.
